Coding standards help programmers write code that is clean, consistent, and easy to understand. At first, using ESLint felt frustrating because of the curly red lines that constantly appeared while I was typing. Even when my program worked correctly, ESLint pointed out small issues like spacing, semicolons, or unused variables. These warnings distracted me and made me feel like I was making too many mistakes. I initially thought those small details were not as important as making the code run. 

However, as I became more familiar with fixing ESLint errors one at a time, I began to see its value. After resolving the warnings, my code looked cleaner and was much easier to read. I realized that coding standards improve not only functionality but also clarity and organization. At the same time, I sometimes felt stressed when I removed errors without fully understanding why they appeared. This made me aware that I needed to learn the meaning behind each rule instead of simply trying to eliminate red lines. 

Through this experience, I developed mixed feelings toward ESLint - both useful and painful. Being exposed to repeated errors encouraged me to write code more carefully from the beginning. I now try to remember the common mistakes I made before so that I can avoid them in future projects. Most importantly, I learned that coding depends heavily on small details. Even tiny elements, such as punctuation or formatting, play an important role in producing high-quality code.
