## From Curiosity to Code

I began my journey in computer Science with curiosity rather than experience. I was drawn to the idea of building things with code-turning abstract concepts into something functional on a screen. I envisioned myself confidently writing code, and that image motivated me to pursue this major, despite having no prior technical background when I entered college. As I began my studies, learning how software systems work quickly became both challenging and intellectually stimulating. Through studying the fundamentals of Computer Science, I developed a strong interest in the logic behind programs and the way complex systems emerge from simple prinicples. Over time, this curiosity grew into a deeper appreciation for structured problem-solving and analytical thinking. 


## Finding Structure, Then Creativity

As a beginner in software engineering, I see my learning process as a staircase-each step built upon core concepts such as algorithms, problem decomposition, and logical reasoning. Writing code has taught me how to approach problems methodically by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces and translating my thought process into clear solutions. Along this journey, I discovered a strong interest in web design. I am particularly drawn to the balance between logic and creativity, where technical functionality meets visual expression. While I am still exploring which specific area to specialize in, this curiosity continues to motivate me to practice, experiment, and grow. 
## Designing Experiences, Not Just Software
My goal is to continuously strengthen my foundational knowledge while gradually expanding my technical skills and perspective. I aim to deepen my understanding of algorithms and software design while gaining more exposure to web technologies and user experience. In the long term, I hope to create digital experiences that are not only technically sound but also thoughtfully designed-websites that are intuitive, visually engaging, and meaningful to users. For me, computer science is not just about writing code, but about shaping ideas into experiences that connect with people and make technology more accessible and impactful.
