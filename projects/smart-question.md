## What is the South Korea Weather Forecast App

The South Korea Weather Forecast App is a location-based application that provides real-time temperature data for major regions across South Korea. The app organizes regions by their major cities - such as Seoul, Busan, and Daegu - and displays current weather information in Celsius, consistent with South Korea's standard climate measurement. Users can interact with a map-based interface to select a region and view its live temperature data. 

## Region-Based Mapping and Data Interaction 
The app uses an interactive map of South Korea, where each region is visually linked to its corresponding weather data. When a user clicks on a specific region, the application displays the selected location along with the current local time and temperature. This visual approach helps users quickly understand regional differences in weather while maintaining an intuitive and engaging user experience.   

## Live Data Integration and API Usage
The core focus of this project was integrating live weather data by connecting a weather data URL to the application's code. I implemented the logic required to fetch real-time temperature data from an external source and update the interface dynamically based on user selection. Through this project, I gained experience working with external data sources, handling live updates, and synchronizing real-time information with interactive UI components.
