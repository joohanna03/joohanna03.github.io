## What is the TODOLIST App

The TODOLIST App is a task-management application designed to help users organize, prioritize, and track their daily responsibilities through an intuitive and interactive interface. The app allows users to create and delete tasks while supporting gesture-based interactions, such as sliding list items left or right to either delete them or mark them as important using a star icon. Tasks are displayed in a vertically ordered list where newly added items appear at the top, ensuring that the most recent and relevant tasks remain easily visible. 

## Task Interaction and Navigation Design
The app includes multiple interaction features to improve usability and efficiency. Each task can be marked as completed using a checkmark button, which visually distinguishes finished tasks from unfinished ones. A toolbar enables smooth navigation between pages, including a view that displays all unfinished tasks and another page dedicated to adding to reduce screen clutter while maintaining clear access to essential functionality.  

## Calendar Integration and UI Design
A key component of this project was the integration of a calendar feature that allows tasks to be saved and associated with specific dates. I focused primarily on implementing the logic for saving tasks, linking them correctly to selected calendar dates, and ensuring they could be retrieved accurately. In addition to functionality, I worked on the visual design of the app, including color choices, button shapes, and layout decisions to create a clean and user-friendly interface. This project strengthened my skills in state management, UI design, and connection interactive components such as calendars with persistent task data.
